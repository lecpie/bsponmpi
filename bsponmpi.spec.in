%description
BSPonMPI offers on any parallel machine supporting MPI a parallel programming
API that adheres to the BSP cost-model. This API is better known as BSPlib and
supports Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) style programs that communicate
using remote memory access (RDMA) and bulk synchronous message passing (BSMP).
This library enables immortal algorithms that once written are scalable
everywhere, since the BSP-cost model prescribes that a program's run-time is
bounded by W + g H + L S, where W, the local computation, H, the total
communiation volume, and S, the number of supersteps, are determined by the
program and g, the message gap (i.e. reciprocal throughput), and L, the
latency, are determined by the machine.
