Introduction
------------

BSPonMPI offers on any parallel machine supporting MPI a parallel programming
API that adheres to the BSP cost-model. This API is better known as BSPlib and
supports Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) style programs that communicate
using Direct Remote Memory Access (DRMA) and Bulk Synchronous Message Passing
(BSMP). This library enables immortal algorithms that once written are
scalable everywhere, since the BSP-cost model prescribes that a program's
run-time is bounded by 

                                W + g H + L S

where W, the local computation, H, the total communiation volume, and S, the
number of supersteps, are determined by the program and g, the message gap
(i.e. reciprocal throughput), and L, the latency, are determined by the
machine. 

Getting Started
---------------

Prerequisites
  - CMake 

  - An MPI-1 implementation, such as MPICH, OpenMPI, MVAPICH, IBM Platform,
    Intel MPI, Microsoft MPI.
    (note: When using a Linux package manager, make sure you get the '-devel'
     package)

  - A C and C++ compiler

   
  - (Optional) Doxygen for generating MAN pages and browseable HTML of the API.


Installation

  - Unpack the source in some directory, e.g. $SRCDIR
  
  - Make a build directory, e.g. $BUILDDIR

  - Think of a place to install the library, e.g. $INSTALLDIR

  - Then execute the following commands

           $ cd $BUILDDIR
          
           $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$INSTALLDIR $SRCDIR 

           $ make

(OPTIONAL) $ make test

           $ make install
